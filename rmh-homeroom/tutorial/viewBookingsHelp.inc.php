<b> <i>How to create a referral for a new guest:</i></b> <br /> <br />
	
	<p><B>Step 1: Pull up a blank referral form</B> <br />
	   On the navigation bar at the top of the page, find 
	   <b>bookings and referrals</b> and select <b>new referral</b>: <br/>
	   
	   <a href="tutorial/screenshots/bookingHelp1.png" class="image" title="bookingHelp1.png"
					target="tutorial/screenshots/bookingHelp1.png"">
	   <img src="tutorial/screenshots/bookingHelp1.png" width="10%" border="1px" align="middle"></a> <br/>
	   	  This will bring you to a blank referral form. 
	   	  </p>
<br />
	<p><B>Step 2: Fill out the form</B> <br /> 
	         
	 Fill out all relevant fields on the form. All fields on the form are required for submission 
	 except for <i>"Alternate Phone #"</i>, <i>"Additional Guests"</i> and <i> "Additional Notes"</i>. <br /><br/>
	          
	 A <i> Primary Guest</i> is an adult responsible for the booking. 
     The house collects contact information for all primary guests. 
	 The default form has fields for one primary guest. <br/>
	 <i> If a booking has an additional primary guest </i>
	 , hit the "+" button. This button will add fields for an 
	 additional primary guest: <br/>

	   <img src="tutorial/screenshots/bookingHelp2.png" width="10%" border="1px" align="middle"></a> <br/>
	 
	 
	  Hitting this button will not affect any information
	  that has already been entered into the form. <br /> <br />
	           
	 Once these fields have been added, they become a required part of the form. 
	 If you have added another set of primary guest fields by mistake, hit the
	 "-" button to remove the most recently added set of fields. 
	 </p> <br/> 
	           
	<p> <b>Step 3: Submit the form</b> <br />
	    Once you have completed the form, hit the 'Submit' button at the bottom of the page. <br/>
	    If you have left any required fields blank, the page will prompt you to fill them in. 
	    After you do so, you can hit 'submit' again. <br />
	    If you wish to clear the form and start over, you can hit the 'Clear Form' button. <br/>
	    If your form has been successfully submitted, you will see the following message: <br/>
	    <a href="tutorial/screenshots/bookingHelp3.png" class="image" title="bookingHelp3.png"
					target="tutorial/screenshots/bookingHelp3.png"">
	   <img src="tutorial/screenshots/bookingHelp3.png" width="10%" border="1px" align="middle"></a> <br/>
	    
	    If you see an error, please contact the house manager.
